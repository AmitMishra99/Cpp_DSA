        ---------------

   - if you know your row and columns for 2D vectors so your initialisizng is given :
        Syntax :  vector<vector<int>v( m , vector<int>(n));

   - In 2d Arrays while passing the array to function we have to mention the row and columns 
        Ex :  int functions( int arr[m][n] ); // it is imp mandatroy to mention the row as well as columns 
               - This is one of the limitation of 2d arrays 
               - Therefore , we mostly used the 2d vectors in leetcode 

   - for computing the rows and colums for a 2D vectors
        int m = matrix.size();               ||   for Calculating the no.of rows
        int n = matrix[0].size();            ||   for Calculating the no.of columns

   - One Special Question - Rotate Image [ 90 ]
        Step - 1 : fisrt make it transpose 
        Step - 2 : next step is reverse the columns

   - if you are creating vectos of vectors try to store-one ur stored 1Dvectore declare it after the ur ith rowth { ith }
   Ex : vector<vector<int>>v1;
        Now we have to create the 1d Vector so we can do it in the our looping condition
